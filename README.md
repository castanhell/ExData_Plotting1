## Note to the evaluator

In this repository you will find 8 files: 4 R scripts, each one consisting on the respective exercise as described on the course assignment and 4 images plots[1-4].png

Pay attention the images provided in the github original repository where slightly bigger (504x504 pixels). I am following the exercise and using 480 per 480.

You will see in the code some comments about some decisions I've made and some references I've followed. Please pay attention I've set up mfrow to c(1,1) on plots1-3 in order to avoid multiplots after running plot4.

I've also decided to use the png function instead of dev.copy(), the reason is the given examples have a transparent background and using png function was the only way I've found to do it transparent too.

Thank you for reading and please take your time to evaluate, I will hopelly evaluate paciently.

Sincerely,

Lucas
